            <hr class="line" style="width: 100%;">
            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unknown place, the river flowed through and over rocks and stones. The noise it made bonded with the sound of frolicking between a boy and his sister by the bank. It was a bright day and someone was approaching to break the fun. It was Lumawig himself. And the God came with news that would forever change the lives of the children.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Lumawig asked that the siblings apprise their parents of a coming flood because he was to craft a dam that would submerge the entire area. All the meat, crops, rice and whatever stores, were to be consumed before the episode. There wasn’t a choice to make.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The kids toddled home to tell their parents of the news that was unfortunately only welcomed as a sort of childish imagination. Both the adults were as insistent in doubt as the kids were in their facts and all the squabbling ended in the eventual departure of both kids to save themselves from what was to come.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">And so begun the adventure of two children whose future is the glory of the people of Talubin.&nbsp;</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">It must have been days or hours of walking and hiking that brought the kids to Wayya. And the land behind them was beginning to be ravaged by the rising water. The place wasn’t even remotely high enough to save themselves from the waters that were being controlled by the god. But what were ahead of them were the elevations of Palang-jey. And they knew they had to be there or tomorrow was doom. After more trekking, they were standing on Palang-jey grounds. A relief if you never turned your back, because when they did, what was behind them was more rising water.
&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There wasn’t time but the peak of the mountain of Kalawitan in the distance gave a call of promise.&nbsp;</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The night was fast approaching and the waters rested. But there was more to danger than expected. The lamans (wild boar) were not to be taken lightly. But the idea of going for the trees was a solution if it meant survival.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The two spent some time wandering in the mountains of Kalawitan and gained age. But they didn’t know whether it was safe enough to go back to their original statement. But the boy had a few options in mind. He first sent a happing (small bird) to scout the former area but the bird never came back. Then he sent an amunin (an animal similar to squirrel). It came back but had nothing to say but show his mouth covered with blood after eating from the corpses of people who were casualties of the flood. The boy had no other choice but to send a zakumo (a large crab). The crab succeeded in his mission not only in giving the two children the right information they needed but being the cause of the subsequent receding of the Zakumo did was to destroy the great planks that were used to dam the region.</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Things weren’t going back to normal as the two had expected because Lumawig reappeared. And he had other things in mind. Lumawig gave them the chance to decide whether to want a place to inhabit or not. Lumawig cast his kawitis (spear) several times to many directions and let the siblings decide whether they liked the area it was cast to. The first place the god’s kawitis landed on was in Ifugo (Ifugao) which the two refused to go because the place was colored with blood (a possible reference to the relentless spitting of red matter from chewing betel nut and certain ingredients (moma) prominent in some parts of the Cordillera Region) and that the place was infested with leeches. A next attempt at casting made the kawitis go to a place populated with loud-speaking people whom the siblings disliked. But the god did not refuse their reasons. And in the events that happened after another chance at casting his spear, he was again denied. The brother and his sister insisted on the notion that Vay-yuk, where the spear went to, was gengahew (reeking) with pig door. In the non-ultimate chance at Lumawig’s flinging, they finally settled with Va-at (what is now known as Ban-ay inTalubin).</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Va-at wasn’t just perfect for them. It exuded that. Hagadjang, a spot across the river form Va-at showed that it could produce superior quality rice. There was also the river for water source and the area was mostly flat.&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;But the almost dreadful surprise when everything was well was an appeal by the god.
</div><div>&nbsp;He insisted that the siblings marry. The two refused when asked individually but no rebuff could defy the god’s decision so the two eventually married. And they stayed in Va-at to build a settlement. It was Lumawig’s plan that things went as they did with the two siblings who ended up being a couple.
</div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As if to put the finishing touches to his work, he asked that the couple give offerings during weddings and births in a part of the area called Valivid. He also insisted that the bamboo growth in Ampehe (located on the western area) that sprung from a veyavey (large bamboo) should not be settled for housing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Lumawig gave these directions and the people of Talubin of today still respect them.</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The people of Talubin and their current community have numbering to 1,758 individuals in a land area of 6,226.47 hectares.&nbsp;</span></div><p></p></div>
